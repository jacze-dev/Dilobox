# Android NameDialog App

The Android NameDialog App is a simple mobile application that demonstrates the usage of a custom dialog fragment. When the user interacts with the "answer" button, a dialog appears, allowing them to input a name. The entered name is then displayed on the main screen.

## Usage

- **View Name:** The app displays a `TextView` named `txtName` on the main screen.

- **Enter a Name:** Click the "answer" button to open the NameDialog.

- **NameDialog:** In the NameDialog, you can input a name, and when you click "Ok," the entered name is displayed in the `txtName` TextView on the main screen.
